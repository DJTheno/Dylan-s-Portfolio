                            I grew up in the food and beverage industry starting at the age of 14. I started out as a
                            bus boy / diswasher and started working my way up the chain. In 2010 I graduated Johnson
                            County Community College with my degree in business administation. After graduation I tried
                            my hand at management and started out as and Assistant Manager for 54th Street Grill and
                            Bar. I spent 2 years there befor moving to the KCI Airport and starting with HMS Host, the
                            food and beverage company for the Airport. I started out as an Assistant Manager and worked
                            every unit we have at the Airport. After Starbucks threatened to pull their brand from HMS
                            they asked me to move to the Starbucks team to help pull them back up. After 6 months of 60
                            hour work weeks and constant training and coaching we took our 27 person schedule and hired
                            50 more associates and opened 3 new stores. We are now the leading brand at KCI and the
                            training stores for all new managers that are hired around the us.
